Nice code! 
Some points to notice:

a) Please add some comments to explain the key steps in your code.

b) For the function **data_size**, it would be better to add a return function.

Good job!
Some points to improve:

a) Please add some comments to explain the key steps in your code.

b) For the function **select_d**, there is no need to use the condition **length(data_dims)==1**.
Since the **data_dims** will be NULL if the input is a vector. The same for the function **omit.case**

c) For the function **omit.case** and  **data_size**, it would be better to add a return function.
